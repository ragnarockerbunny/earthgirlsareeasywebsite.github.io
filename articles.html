                    AR Cloud</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Introduction:&nbsp;<br>Experts believe that the AR Cloud will grow to be the single most important software program infrastructure in the records of computing, far bigger than Google’s search index and Facebook’s social graph. 
<br>
<br>The AR Cloud will emerge as the operating device for the spatial era. Not solely will it strengthen planet-scale, multi-user AR experiences. However, it will also contribute to and derive some value to self-driving cars, drones, and other related gadgets and buildings. 
<br>
<br>Starting point and Brief Overview:<br>Before 2017 the word AR (augmented reality) did not have a big meaning but in 2017 AR went mainstream and people started to show an interest. At the start AR apps were hard to develop, hard to distribute and had no demand, but all that changed in 2017 with the introduction of Software Development Kit by Apple, Google and Facebook that made AR applications easy to build. In order to make AR apps to break through the novelty phase AR experiences must continue in the real world across space and devices. To enable these kinds of experiences a software needed to be developed to achieve this, so the AR cloud was developed. The AR cloud can be referred to as a Realtime spatial map of the world. The AR cloud holds a lot of potential and can become the single most important software infrastructure in computing. The AR cloud created a new way to organise the world’s information at its origin.<br><br>What is it:<br>The AR cloud is a real-time spatial map of the world overlayed onto the real world. The AR cloud enables information to be augmented and shared across apps and devices. The idea is to share augmented reality experiences in real time and not through a recording, to allow more users to have the same AR experience.  The AR cloud could organize the world’s information visually and “in situ,” meaning where items actually are. In other words, instead of searching on google to give us information about something around us, the AR cloud could give us information on objects and places simply by pointing a camera at it.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Current Applications And Related Tech:<br>The functionality of AR Cloud in today’s world is limited. It’s slowly gaining traction with a projected hype peak in 5-10 years according to the Garter Hype Cycle. The list of uses for the AR Cloud are momentous as is the effect it will have on our current state of living.
<br>Right now AR technology is used for 
<br>·       instructions for employees
<br>·       spatial AR-based cooperation between workers
<br>·       spatial knowledge management
<br>·       navigation in open areas.
<br>See our brain requires you to put labels to things to recognize them but AR Cloud focus on spatial awareness gives it an advantage to adjust to its surrounding area and evenly map out interior and exterior areas.
<br>You get companies working on perfecting their AR technology. Big names interested in this is Microsoft with their HoloLens (an example of MR) and Niantic creators of Pokemon Go!, but recently smaller startups have started to shift their focus to primarily AR and it’s looking exciting.
<br>Blipper has taken steps towards computer vision. Not just identifying objects (Like a boy and his mother walking their dog) but understanding the relationship between them. Smaller scale stuff like Virtual.ai is also promising. They invented Placenote, an app that allows users to build their own AR apps for personal indoor mapping e.g. pointing your phone at your printer and instructions appear. Then you get 6D.ai, recently purchased by Niantic, who is currently working on piecing together all these bit of information from different apps to create a virtual, interactable world map.
<br>Even though there’s not a lot we can do with the AR Cloud now, it has sparked various debates on how an AR world would change our lives. Not just the social interaction for the users but also how it impacts the business and financial world including:
<br>Security – protection for different data hierarchies.
<br>Personality – which data is relevant or displayed to each individual person.
<br>Ethics – Which data is public or private. And what content is allowed to be captured.
<br>The only similar technologies is VR, AR and MR. VR requires some sort of sight aversion tech to fully immerse like an Oculus Rift. AR requires a device like a smartphone to view digital elements through the device. XR is a mixture of both AR and VR. The AR Cloud combines all these elements. The cool thing about it is that it’s the end goal, the final step in immersive technology.       
<br><br>Future Development:<br>We’ve talked about the past, the present, so now we must look to the future. While many applications of AR Cloud have been found, the next question we must ask is what lies in store? Where do we go from here and what can we expect in the future?
<br>
<br>The founder of Spatial (a company which has developed Immersive Office software) has speculated on commercial applications, such as combining the inn-app purchases of digital storefronts, augmented reality and AR Cloud functionality. The example that Anand Agwala gives is that of seeing a poster for an event, and viewing it in an AR Space which then ties into the AR Cloud by providing the functionality to purchase tickets for that event (A. Strange, 2019)
<br>
<br>Foundry’s Insight Hub expects a freemium approach might be adopted where users can trade time, data or micropayments for functionality, showing an entirely different method of monetizing virtual space. Insight Hub also has expects that know security and privacy risks will be opened up and development might need to focus more on protecting users. (Foundry, 2019). Users are becoming more aware of the risks to their privacy and protecting their data has become a core concern. Plus, with the introduction of legislation like COPPA that has in some ways already been outdated, we might be looking at a potential overall in future of how we regulate data once again.
<br>
<br>Mobile AR Devices, such as smart glasses, could potentially also provide comprehensive user profiles by recording data such as where the user is looking and what catches their eye (HowToTechnology, 2019). This is interesting as while using cookies, companies have been able to build user profiles which can to a degree of accuracy predict purchasing habits, such direct data has never been available outside of user testing.
<br>
<br>The real thing to look forward to is the advent of 5G technology which will finally bring certain data heavy AR functionalities into a space of viability. Borodin of Dev actually speculates that the introduction of GPS III, the new generation of satnav technology, might also be what propels AR Cloud into the future with its highly accurate readings. (Borodin, 2019).
<br><br>Conclusion:<br>In all this discussion it might seem like AR Cloud is a varied and complex topic, and it certainly can be, but what we do know is this:
<br>
<br>It’s being used for some incredible things right now and the next integration of AR in our lives will most likely test much more of our ability to preserve human interaction and to perceive the world without technological filters. Covering gaming, office, virtual space, and navigation applications we’re currently seeing the incredible future marriage of 5G, AR and GPS 3, not forgetting AI, the AR Cloud is an amazing creation capable of upending reality as we know it.
<br>
<br>The day where humans can interact with every part of the world we live in is on the horizon and we’re really looking at a technological revolution.
<br>
<br>However, considering the fact that the future isn’t an easy thing to predict and no one will have it right 100%. We can look at trends, we can look at statistics but there’s one thing that we know for sure; nothing is set in stone, and an upset can come from anywhere.
<br>
<br>Still, while some of the privacy and security concerns look grim and the monetization poses both opportunities and risks, there are lots of reasons to be optimistic since while AR is rapidly developing, other fields are revolutionizing themselves simultaneously and new possibilities arise every day as closely related technologies leap forward into a new generation.&nbsp;<br></p>
